					<h3 class="text-blue upper text-center m-t-5"><b>REASONS TO REGISTER A PRIVATE LIMITED COMPANY in India</b></h3>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><p><b>Credibility </b>
							<br>Registering a Pvt. Ltd. Co. facilitates credibility of the business. Nowadays, customers, vendors and investors look for credibility in the business entity before dealing. It creates a professional image and boosts the business value. Most importantly, registration ensures a certain degree of brand uniqueness and also eliminates duplication in the market.

							<li><p><b>Convertibility</b><br>A registered Private Limited Company India can convert its structure into a Public Limited Company. This helps to have a broader access to the market.</p></li>

							<li><p><b>Protection of Personal Assets </b>
							<br>Pvt. Ltd. Formation allows limited liability. In case of a wind up, only the assets of the business can be taken away by the creditors. They cannot touch any personal assets of the members.</p></li>

							<li><p><b>Funding</b><br>For any new business enterprise, funding is a very crucial aspect of establishing, maintaining and growing a business.
