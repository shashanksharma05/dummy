					<p>In India, we as a citizen have to pay two types of taxes i.e. Direct tax and Indirect tax. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a type of Indirect tax which has replaced many other indirect taxes in India.  The Goods and services tax act was passed by the parliament on March 29th,In India, we as a citizen have to pay two types of taxes i.e. Direct tax and Indirect tax. Goods and Services Tax is an of Indirect tax which has replaced many other indirect taxes in India. The Goods and services tax act was passed by the parliament on March 29th, 2017 which came into effect on July 1st, 2017. In the year 2000, a committee was set up to draft GST law and it took its final form in 2017, therefore GST took 17 years to come into its real application in India.</p>
<p>It is basically levied on the sale of goods and services and now it is the only tax charged replacing various other previously existing indirect tax laws in India.</p>
<p>GST is a multi - stage and destination based tax law, which is levied at every point of sale of goods and services. Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) and State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) is charged in case of transactions occurring intra – state while in case of inter – state, Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) is charged.</p>
<p>The production of goods and services goes through many stages from manufacturer to final sale to the customer. Thus it is levied at each stage, making it the multi – stage tax. It is charged only to the value added at each stage by the seller. It is levied at the point of consumption, hence it is destination based. Get GST Registration in India with help of Company Vakil Expert Lawyers, CA’s and CS at most affordable prices.					</p>
					<h3 class="text-blue upper text-center m-t-5"><b>What is CGST, SGST & IGST?</b></h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>CGST means Central Goods and Services tax and SGST means State Goods and Services tax. When there is a transaction that takes place within a state i.e. intra state then CGST & SGST is levied. A transaction where buyer and the seller are located in the same state, seller collects CGST & SGST from the buyer. The Central and the State governments, both agree to combine the charges in an appropriate proportion for sharing the revenue on a sale of goods and services that takes place intra-state but the tax rate should not exceed 14% each.</li>
							<li>IGST means Integrated Goods and Services Tax which is charged on sales that take place between two or more states. This is levied when the location of the buyer and the seller is in different states. When an export or import of goods or services takes place and when the supply of goods or services is done to or by a SEZ unit, the deal is presumed to be Inter-State and IGST is charged. A seller collects IGST from the buyer in case of inter – state transactions. The taxes have been segregated for the fact that both central and state government need to raise funds for their development and offering services and responsibilities.

						<h4>Who needs a GST Registration?</h4>
						<p>It is needed by every business exceeding the threshold limit of Rs. 20 Lakhs (Rs. 10 Lakhs in case of North Eastern and Hill States), any business registered under previous Indirect Tax Laws (i.e. VAT, Service Tax and Excise) and apart from these there are some special cases too.
