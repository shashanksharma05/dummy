					<h3 class="text-blue upper text-center"><b>Copyright Registration in India</b></h3>
					<p>Copyright as the name suggests arose as an exclusive right of the author to copy the literature produced by him and stop others from doing so.</p>

					<p>Copyright deals with the rights of intellectual creators in their creation.</p>

					<p>Nowadays copyright law has extended protection not only to literary, dramatic,, musical and artistic works but also sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programs and typographical arrangements of publications. Computer programs have also been brought within the purview of copyright law.</p>

					<p>Copyright registration in India is done as per the provisions of Copyright Act, 1957. It provides protection to the work of creator so that it cannot be copied by anyone and to restore the uniqueness of the product. Creativity being the keystone of progress, no civilized society can afford to ignore the basic requirement of encouraging the same. Copyright ensures certain minimum safeguards of the rights of authors over their creations, thereby protecting and rewarding creativity.</p>

					<p>The significant reason behind registration of a copyright on the work by the artists, publishers and corporates is that it’s the only way to approach the courts in case of a dispute. This provides a legal protection to the owners of the registered copyright. Register musical, sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programs and typographical arrangements copyrights from Jaipur, Mumbai, Bangalore, Tamilnadu, Gurugram, GOA, Haryana, Gujarat, West Bengal, assam, Pune, Kerala, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Indore, Kolkata, karnataka, maharashtra, uttar pradesh, telangana, coimbatore, patiala, chennai etc with Companyvakil.  </p>

					<p>Registration of Copyright protects copyright of a person in a work produced by his intellectual labour irrespective of his status.</p>
