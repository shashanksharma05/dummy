					<p>A Trademark distinguishes the goods of a manufacturer or trader from similar goods of others and therefore, it seeks to protect the interest of the trader as well as the consumer.</p>

					<p>The <a href="https://www.companyvakil.com/trademark-objection">object of trademark</a> law is to permit an enterprise by registering its trademark to obtain an exclusive right to use, share or assign a mark.</p>

					<p>A registered Trademark can be assigned and renewed. Before expiry of the last registration of a trademark, the Registrar will send a notice as a reminder to the registered trademark owner regarding the expiration and conditions as to the payment of the fees. The rights of the <a href="https://www.companyvakil.com/trademark-registration">trademark registration</a> owner continue to operate until the registration of the trademark is either cancelled or expires, and subsequently removed from the trademark register.</p>

					<p>Registration for a trademark can be renewed every ten years from the date of filing of the application for registration. There is no limit as to the number of times that the trademark can be renewed, and any person can renew the trademark as long as the renewal is made as per the rules and regulations of Intellectual property laws governing trademarks.</p>

					<p>Assignments pertain to the transfer of trademark right from the owner of the right to another person. Assignment can be done for both registered and unregistered trademarks. In case of a registered Trademark, such assignment is required to be recorded in the Register of trademarks.

					<h3 class="text-blue upper text-center m-t-5"><b>What is Trademark Assignment?</b></h3>
					
					<p>Assignments pertain to the transfer of trademark right from the owner of the right to another person. Assignment can be done for both registered and unregistered trademarks. In case of an assignment, there is a change in the ownership of the registered trademark. Sometimes, while executing a complete assignment, the owner of the trademark transfers all the rights with relation to the trademark, together with the transfer of the rights like the right to any transfer, earn royalties, etc., to the other party. The transferring party known as the assignor transfers the trademark right to the receiving party known as the assignee. Subsequent to the assignment of a trademark, the assignee becomes the proprietor of the trademark. Trademark assignment is affected by a duly executed assignment deed between the assignor and the assignee.</p>

					<p>Assignments lead to creation of multiple exclusive rights.</p>
					
					<p>In case of a registered Trademark, such assignment is required to be recorded in the Register of trademarks.</p>
					
					<p>The most crucial requirement for a valid agreement of assignment is that there must be evidence of an intention on the part of the assignor to transfer ownership of the trademark as well as the associated goodwill to the assignee.
