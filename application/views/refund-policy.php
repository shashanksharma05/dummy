                    <h4>Not Satisfied? Let us know!</h4>
                    <p>If you're not satisfied with the service, simply email info@CompanyVakil.com or create a help ticket. All help tickets are reviewed by members of the Senior Management and personally responded within 24-48 hours.</p>

                    <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
                    <p>When a payment of fee is made to CompanyVakil, the fees paid in advance is retained by CompanyVakil in a client account. CompanyVakil will earn the fees upon working on a client's matter. During an engagement, CompanyVakil earns fee at different rates and different times depending on the completion of various milestones (e.g. providing client portal access, assigning relationship manager, obtaining DIN, Filing of forms, etc.,). Refund cannot be provided for earned fee because resources and man hours spent on delivering the service are non-returnable in nature. Further, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. Under any circumstance, CompanyVakil shall be liable to refund only upto the fee paid by the client.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Change of Service</h4>
                    <p>If you want to change the service you ordered for a different one, you must request this change of service within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original service, less any earned fee and money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your CompanyVakil account. You can use the balance credit for any other CompanyVakil service.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Standard Pricing</h4>
                    <p>CompanyVakil has a standard pricing policy wherein no additional service fee is requested under any circumstance. However, the standard pricing policy is not applicable for an increase in the total fee paid by the client to CompanyVakil due to increase in government fee or fee incurred by the client for completion of legal documentation or re-filing of forms with the government due to rejection or resubmission. CompanyVakil is not responsible or liable for any other cost incurred by the client related to the completion of the service.</p>

                    <h4>Factors Outside our Control</h4>
                    <p>We cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of CompanyVakil service. In some cases, a government backlog or problems with the government platforms (e.g. MCA website, Income Tax website, FSSAI website) can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, CompanyVakil does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the Associates suggested outside of CompanyVakil platform, who are not employed by CompanyVakil. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee or eligible for refund. Hence, delay in processing of your file by the Government cannot be a reason for refund.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Force Majeure</h4>
                    <p>CompanyVakil shall not be considered in breach of its Satisfaction Guarantee policy or default under any terms of service, and shall not be liable to the Client for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of its obligations by reason of earthquake, flood, fire, storm, lightning, drought, landslide, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, natural disaster, act of God or the public enemy, epidemic, famine or plague, action of a court or public authority, change in law, explosion, war, terrorism, armed conflict, labor strike, lockout, boycott or similar event beyond our reasonable control, whether foreseen or unforeseen (each a "Force Majeure Event").</p>

                    <h4>Cancellation Fee</h4>
                    <p>Since we're incurring costs and dedicating time, manpower, technology resources and effort to your service or document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by CompanyVakil - not changes to your situation or your state of mind. In case you require us to hold the processing of a service, we will hold the fee paid on your account until you are ready to commence the service.</p>
                    <p>Before processing any refund, we reserve the right to make best effort to complete the service. In case, you are not satisfied with the service, a cancellation fee of 20% + earned fee + fee paid to government would be applicable. In case of change of service, the cancellation fee would not be applicable.</p>
