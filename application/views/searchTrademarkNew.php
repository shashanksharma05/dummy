			</li>
			<li>
				TM Status - In simple terms trademark status can be considered as the Stages a Trade-mark passes during the process of Registration. Some of the most common stages during the process are as follows :-
				<ul>
					<li>New TM Application - We can call it the Inception of a New Trademark Application basically it is the initiation of Trade-mark Registration Process. Every mark has to be filed via New Application, even the FLIPKART (Trademark) mark filed for a New TM Application.</li>
					<li>Send To Vienna Codification- This stage arise when there is a Device Logo Trademark to be filed and during this process the design of the logo is basically codified as per the standards laid down under Vienna Agreement. After New Application FLIPKART (Trademark) Trademark status would become this.</li>
					<li>Formality Check Pass - If all the documents are submitted to the Government Department and the information provided is completely correct then the mark status changes from Send To Vienna Codification to FCP. At Company Vakil we ensure that wordmarks or logos like FLIPKART (Trademark), filed via our portal always gets through the stage of Formality check Pass without any failures.</li>
					<li>Examination Report Issued -  This stage arise post FCP when the TM passes to the next level i.e. the mark has reached the Examiner and the examiner has released the report and the result is about to be published. The next level for FLIPKART (Trademark) TM  would be to clear the Examiner-s quality check and wait for the exam report to be issued on the same.</li>
					<li>Objected - One of the major stages during the Trade-mark approval process is of Trade-mark Objection, i.e. it-s the point at which a brand actually gets stuck due to certain structural, phonetic similarities or maybe due to non-distinctive nature of the mark. Company Vakil Experts are highly specialized in drafting Trademark Objection Replies, so feel free to reach us if you are stuck over the same. If FLIPKART (Trademark) Mark has some similarity to other marks in the same category or is non-distinctive in nature then the registrar has the full reason to Object the same, until further reply over the same.</li>
					<li>Advertised before Acceptance - Once a Trade-mark passes the Registrar-s Examination, then the same is advertised in the journal for a period of 4 months, during that time period the TM Status stays as Advertised before Acceptance. As the examiner clears of marks like FLIPKART (Trademark), they automatically get promoted and published in the journal for 4 months.</li>
					<li>Opposed - This arises only when a 3rd party files an opposition against the trademark filed by the applicant. A mark can be opposed only during the 4 months period of its advertisement in the journal. Company Vakil. If any 3rd Party feels FLIPKART (Trademark) Trade-mark is infringing upon their rights then they are fully eligible to Oppose the same on those grounds.</li>
					<li>Accepted and Advertised - Once the 4 Month window ends or the opposition proceedings goes in applicant-s favour, then on that moment the mark gets Accepted and Advertised, now this means that  the registry has accepted the TM and its even advertised in the journal as well. So after completion of 4 months at Advertised before Acceptance Status FLIPKART (Trademark)  would move to Accepted and Advertised in the journal.</li>
					<li>Registered - This is the final point of any Trade-mark Application filed, once all the above pointers are passed, then finally a mark reaches the Registration stage and the mark become eligible to use - symbol next to it. This is the full and final Stage for marks like FLIPKART (Trademark) and once the applicant receives the Certificate, the Brand is Treated as an asset of the applicant i.e. Flipkart Internet Private Limited (TrademarkApplicant)</li>
					<li>Refused - if a mark is questionable on certain rules under the law, then the IP Indian Registry has full right to refuse the TM from being processed and this status shows up next to the applied TM.</li>
					<li>Removed - When a mark is removed from the official Register of TM Registry by the Registrar, then TM Status is shown as Removed next to the concerned mark.</li>
					<li>Rectification filed - In certain cases some Trademarks get through all the stages of Trade-mark Registration, but if someone feels that the Registered mark has some issues or is infringing upon a certain brand, then the concerned person has the full right and option to file a Rectification against the same. Post the stage of Registration if someone wishes to challenge FLIPKART (Trademark) Trademark then they would have to file a Rectification for the same.</li>
					<li>Abandoned - There are many reasons for abandonment some of the major prominent ones are like If a mark surpasses the 10 years time period of validity and it-s not renewed within the given period or if a certain reply has to be given at some stage of the tm process and the same  is not provided within a particular time period then the Trade-mark can be abandoned by the registry. If after Registration FLIPKART (Trademark) Brand isn-t renewed on completion of 10 years or its owner Flipkart Internet Private Limited (TrademarkApplicant) neglects any of the required compliance during the process of Registration then it can get abandoned.</li>
					<li>-	Withdrawn - At time TM Owners themselves withdraw the applied TM due to some or other reason, at that moment WITHDRAWN Status is shown for the same.
